# final project

### Instructions

1. This final project is intended to encourage you to use the models introduced throughout the course on problems that are of particular interest to you. Bring to bear your deep substantive knowledge of the problem in this assignment. Use data that is interesting and meaningful to you.
2. Use a **Jupyter notebook** for this assignment and `push` it back to this repo. When you are done with this assignment **submit the link to this GitHub repo through Courseworks**.
3. **PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NOT GRADE YOUR FINAL PROJECT UNTIL THE LINK HAS BEEN SUBMITTED ON COURSEWORKS. BE MINDFUL OF LATE SUBMISSION PENALTIES.**

2. [`10 pts`] describe your **data** (including the features, target, and the general type of data you are working with)
3. [`10 pts`] describe **why** you think **Deep Learning systems** would be a good methodological choice, and the **specific architecture(s)** you think appropriate to explore
4. [`50 pts`] show the code and outputs of **3-5 different experiments** with variants of your proposed architecture(s)  
5. [`20 pts`] select the model that best fits the problem you are trying to solve and discuss **why it fulfills this purpose**
